lista pelda

* **Overall Performance Score** - I think it is obvious why.
* **Time to Interactive (TTI)** - because it marks the point at which your website is both visually rendered and capable of reliably responding to user input.
* **First Meaningful Paint (FMP)** - because it influences potential user engagement,
* **Estimated Input Latency (EIL)** - because it measures the time you click on a button and the time something actually happens. It measures “a lag”. It measures the level of the user’s frustration. You don’t want to have everything rendered, but you click and nothing happens. Sometimes it’s better to delay the first contentful paint to optimize input latency.
