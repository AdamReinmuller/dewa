services-subtitle: I am beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God. All my people from
  the front to the back nod, back nod. The way I am racing around the track, call

  before General Zod. This planet Krypton – no, Asgard, Asgard.
fenyezo-description: When you walked through the door. It was clear to me (Clear to
  me). You’re the one they adore. Who they came to see (Who they came to see). You’re
  a rock star (Baby). Everybody wants you (Everybody wants you). Player, who can really

  this too far.
felulet-desc: I never meant to give you mushrooms, girl. I never meant to bring you
  to my world. Now you sitting in the corner crying. And now it's my fault, my fault.
  I never meant to give you mushrooms, girl. I never meant to bring you to my world.
