Hi jc,

I started writing this letter and updating my CV as soon as I saw the tweet that you are looking for a frontend dev.
I was more than happy to see it as I am eager to increment that number on my current environment of web2 to 3 professionally like I have already done it in my personal projects and mindspace long ago.

This opportunity really caught my attention as I am particularly fascinated by TreasureDAO's vision and community and would be awesome to be able to help building it out and
it would be a tremendous opportunity to learn and better myself in this area.

Let this funny coincidence demonstrate that I indeed like the project: 
I just locked my MAGIC tokens away for 12 months a day before the hiring tweet.

I attached my CV and hope to hear from you soon sir :)

Cheers,
Adam "Rein" Rajmuller
